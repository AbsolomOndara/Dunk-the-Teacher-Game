This Python game challenges players to guess the coordinates where their teacher is hiding on a grid. You have 6 attempts to guess the correct (X,Y) position. After each wrong guess, the game tells you how far away your guess was from the teacher.

## Features

- ðŸŽ¯ Random teacher placement for each game
- ðŸ“Š Distance feedback after each guess
- ðŸŽ¨ Colorful terminal interface
- âœ… Input validation
- ðŸ“ˆ Difficulty hints (hot/cold indicators)
- ðŸ˜„ Fun ASCII art and emoji visuals

## Installation

   ```bash

Install the required dependency:

bash
pip install colorama

Read the instructions

Enter your X guess (1-10)

Enter your Y guess (1-10)

You'll get feedback about your guess:
